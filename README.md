# Anki deck for Duolingo Chinese

Anki is a natural companion to Duolingo. Duolingo is good at introducing new grammar concepts and words, while Anki is good at making you actually remember them.

1. [Download the apkg file](https://github.com/anki-decks/anki-deck-for-duolingo-chinese/blob/master/Chinese%20Duolingo%20for%20English%20speakers.apkg).
2. Open it in AnkiDroid, AnkiMobile, or Anki Desktop.
3. Each day after using Duolingo, use Anki.

# Copyright guidelines

- This deck contains only words, not sentences. The reason is that sentences can be considered as intellectual property, whereas a list of words can not. So, please do not add sentences from Duolingo or from elsewhere.
- Do not copy English translations from any other source (and especially, not from Duolingo). Just simplify or fix the existing definitions.
- Before you add anything to the TSV file, ask yourself whether it is open data or not, and make it clear in your commit message.

# Thanks

Huge thanks to Anish for creating the words list.
